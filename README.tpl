## `no_std` support

`no_std` support can be enabled by compiling with `--no-default-features` to disable `std` support and `--features hashbrown` for `Hash` collections that are only defined in `std` for internal usages in crate. For example:

```toml
[dependencies]
gpu-allocator = { version = "0.27.0", default-features = false, features = ["hashbrown", "other features"] }
```

To support both `std` and `no_std` builds in your project, use the following in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[features]
default = ["std", "other features"]

std = ["gpu-allocator/std"]
hashbrown = ["gpu-allocator/hashbrown"]
other_features = []

[dependencies]
gpu-allocator = { version = "0.27.0", default-features = false }
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

The MSRV for this crate and the `vulkan`, `d3d12` and `metal` features is Rust **1.71**.

The `no_std` support requires Rust **1.81** or higher because `no_std` support of dependency `thiserror` requires `core::error::Error` which is stabilized in **1.81**.

Any other features such as the `visualizer` (with all the `egui` dependencies) may have a higher requirement and are not tested in our CI.
